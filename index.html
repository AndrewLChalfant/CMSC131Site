      </h2>
      <h2>Course Overview</h2>
      <p>This is a first programming course for Computer Science majors with a
        focus on object-oriented programming. The goal of the course is to
        develop skills such as program design and testing as well as the
        implementation of programs using a graphical IDE. All programming will
        be done in Java and Processing. Processing will be used as a visual way
        to teach basic language features and we will switch to Java later this
        semester.</p>
      <p>The course <a href="http://www.piazza.com/umd/spring2018/cmsc131010x030x040x">Piazza</a>
        page and ELMS are the sources for course information. TA office hours,
        additional resources and essential course information will appear on
        Piazza, and all course-related questions will also be answered on Piazza
        to ensure all students have equal access to the information. Important
        class announcements will be posted in ELMS. </p>
      <br>

      <br class="Apple-interchange-newline">
      <h2></h2>
      <h2>Assignments</h2>
      <p>This is a very demanding course. You will need to complete up to 11
        projects and up to 11 graded labs. The dues for the projects and the
        graded labs are 11:00 PM on the day they are due. They are to be
        submitted electronically according to instructions given with the
        assignments. Late assignments will be strictly penalized. Exceptional
        circumstances will be considered only if discussed with the instructor
        before the assignment is due. Late assignments will have points deducted
        as follows: </p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <li> 20 percent late penalty will be applied if you submit within 24
          hours from the due. </li>
        <li>No late submission will be accepted after 24 hours.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Again, NO late submission after 24 hours will be accepted.</strong>
        In case that your work is to be submitted to the <a href="https://submit.cs.umd.edu">submit
          server</a>, you can submit multiple times and the best submission will
        be used for grading. <strong>Do not wait until the last moment but
          submit multiple times before the due date.</strong></p>
      <p>For the first few projects, the description will be posted in ELMS.
        Later, we will distribute the starter files for the projects in the <a href="http://www.grace.umd.edu">Grace</a>
        cluster using a source code repository.&nbsp; We will announce once we
        complete setting up your accounts.</p>
      <p>You will be allowed to drop one graded lab. The dropped lab won't be
        counted for your final grade. More than one will affect your final
        grade. </p>
      <p>You will also be allowed to drop one project, even though we apply the
        Good Faith Attempt Policy for projects. However, <strong>the drop
          option can only be used for a few projects.</strong> Whether you can
        drop a project will be specified in the project description or will be
        announced in ELMS. </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Good Faith Attempt Policy for Projects</h2>
      <p> You must submit your work that satisfies a minimum set of requirements
        for every project (Good Faith Attempt ; GFA) by the GFA deadline.
        Otherwise, you will not pass the course (automatic grade of F). </p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <li>Each project will define its own GFA criteria and deadline. </li>
        <li>Note that you will NOT receive points for completing the good faith
          attempt. The grade you obtain in the project will be based on your
          ontime/late submission. </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2> Online-Posting of Your Project Implementations is Not Allowed </h2>
      <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <li>Do not post your assignments' implementation online (e.g., GitHub)
          where they can be seen by others.</li>
        <li>Making your code accessible to others can lead to academic integrity
          violations. Even if the course is over, do not make your code
          available to others. </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2>Exams</h2>
      <p>There will be 3 midterm exams and one final exam. The exam dates are: </p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <li>Midterm exam 1: Feb. 23rd </li>
        <li>Midterm exam 2: Mar. 28th</li>
        <li>Midterm exam 3: Apr. 27th</li>
        <li>Final exam: May 14th</li>
      </ul>
      Once we have graded any class material (e.g., exams, projects, etc.) we
      will post an announcement and a deadline by which you must submit any
      regrade request (if necessary). It is your responsibility to submit
      regrade requests by the specified deadline; <strong>no regrade requests
        will be processed afterwards.</strong> If the regrade request deadline
      is not announced, it is by default one week after the your grades are
      posted.<br>
      <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2>Grading</h2>
      <p>Final grades will be computed according the following weights. (These
        weights are tentative and subject to future adjustment.)&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <li>Midterm exam 1: 10%<br>
        </li>
        <li>Midterm exam 2: 15%</li>
        <li>Midterm exam 3: 15%</li>
        <li>Final exam: 25%</li>
        <li>Projects: 25%</li>
        <li>Graded labs: 5%</li>
        <li>Clicker (Participation+Questions) / Survey / etc.: 5%</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Written tests will be graded using <a href="https://gradescope.com/">GradeScope</a>.
        We will add you to the service and send out an invitation code later to
        your email addresses available in UMEG. You should use the email address
        you receive the invitation code when you create an account in
        GradeScope. </p>
      <p>In the end, all your grades will be entered into the <a href="https://grades.cs.umd.edu/">grade
          server</a>. It will be your dashboard to check your progress. Before
        your grades are entered to the grade server, you will be able to check
        your grades for written tests in GradeScope. The grades for your
        projects and graded lab submissions will be available in the <a href="https://submit.cs.umd.edu/">submit
          server</a>. </p>
      <p>The cutoffs for letter grades will be decided after the final. We will
        review the total score distributions and decide the cutoffs between two
        scores with significant gaps compared to the ones above and below. Note
        that the cutoff for A and B could be set above 90 and 80, respectively.</p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2>TA Room/Office Hours</h2>
      <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
      </ul>
      Office hours get extremely busy the day before a project deadline.
      Therefore start working on your projects early. Regarding office hours and
      the TA Room:
      <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <li>Once you have been helped by a TA, please leave the TA room. We have
          a large number of students in all of our classes, and the TA room is
          really crowded. Thank you for help on this matter. </li>
        <li>If there is a line of students waiting, a TA should spent at most 10
          minutes with a student. Please remind TAs about this rule. </li>
        <li>When you visit the TA room, <strong>find the TAs for Roger/Yoon and
            write your name in the waiting list on the board.</strong> (We are
          planning to use a system for the wait queue management. Once we decide
          to use the system, it will be announced.)</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
      <p>Note that academic dishonesty includes not only cheating, fabrication,
        and plagiarism, but also includes helping other students commit acts of
        academic dishonesty by allowing them to obtain copies of your work. In
        short, all submitted work must be your own. </p>
      <p>Cases of academic dishonesty will be pursued to the fullest extent
        possible as stipulated by the <a href="https://www.studentconduct.umd.edu/" target="new">Office
          of Student Conduct.</a><span style="color: #0000ee;"></span> <br>
      </p>
      <p>It is very important for you to be aware of the consequences of
        cheating, fabrication, facilitation, and plagiarism. If the student is
        found to be responsible of academic dishonesty, the typical sanction
        results in a special grade "XF", indicating that the course was failed
        due to academic dishonesty. If you have any doubt as to whether an act
        of yours might constitute academic dishonesty, please contact your TA or
        the course coordinator. </p>
      <p>For more information on the Code of Academic Integrity or the Student
        Honor Council, please visit <a href="http://www.shc.umd.edu" target="new">http://www.shc.umd.edu</a>.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Examples of Academic Integrity Violations</h2>
      <p>The following are examples of academic integrity violations:</p>
      <ul style="padding-left: 60px">
        <li> Hardcoding of results in a project assignment. Hardcoding refers to
          attempting to make a program appear as if it works correctly (e.g.,
          printing expected results for a test). </li>
        <li> Using any code available on the internet/web or any other source.
          For example, using code from Sourceforge. </li>
        <li> Hiring any online service to complete an assignment for you. </li>
        <li> <strong> You may not post the implementation of your assignments,
            materials related to the class (e.g., project description), or any
            other material associated with this course. Even if the class is
            over and you have graduated, you may NOT post any material. If you
            do, you might be violating academic integrity rules and copyrights.
          </strong> </li>
        <li> Discussing project implementations (everything beyond
          clarifications) with your classmates. </li>
        <li> Sharing your code or your student tests with any student. </li>
        <li> Providing ideas/suggestions on how to solve/implement a programming
          assignment. </li>
        <li> Looking at another student's code. </li>
        <li>Using online forums to ask for help regarding our assignments.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additional information can be found in the sections titled "Academic
        Integrity" and "Code of Student Conduct" available at <a href="http://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html">Course
          Related Policies</a>.</p>
      <br>
      <h2> Disabilities Support Accommodations</h2>
      <p>In case academic accommodations are needed, you must provide a letter
        of accommodation from the Office of Accessibility and Disability
        Services (ADS) within the first TWO weeks of the semester. For details,
        see the section titled "Accessibility" available at <a href="http://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html">Course
          Related Policies</a>.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Excused Absence and Academic Accommodations</h2>
      <p>The university allows for self-documentation for some absences. If you
        need to be excused for an absence from a single lecture, recitation, or
        lab due to your illness (or other reasons), you shall make a reasonable
        attempt to report prior to the class. (Use the absence report feature in
        the grade server).<br>
        <br>
        Upon returning to the class, present with a self-signed note attesting
        to the date of your illness (or other reasons). Each note must contain
        an acknowledgment by the student that the information provided is true
        and correct. Providing false information to University officials is
        prohibited under Part 9(i) of the Code of Student Conduct (V-1.00(B)
        University of Maryland Code of Student Conduct) and may result in
        disciplinary action. <br>
        <br>
        <strong> Self-documentation may NOT be used for the midterm exams and
          the final exam</strong>, and it may only be used for only 1 class
        meeting (or more, if you choose) during the semester. Any student who
        needs to be excused for a prolonged absence (2 or more consecutive class
        meetings), or for the exams, must provide written documentation of the
        illness from the Health Center or from an outside health care provider.
        This documentation must verify dates of treatment and indicate the time
        frame that the student was unable to meet academic responsibilities. In
        addition, it must contain the name and phone number of the medical
        service provider to be used if verification is needed. No diagnostic
        information will ever be requested. Note that the "Medical Discharge
        Summary" from the Health Center will NOT be accepted as evidence of
        doctor's recommendation for your absence. <br>
        <br>
        For additional details, see the section titled "Attendance, Absences, or
        Missed Assignments" available at <a href="http://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html">Course
          Related Policies</a> </p>
      <br>
