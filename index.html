  <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
  <p>Note that academic dishonesty includes not only cheating, fabrication, and plagiarism, but also includes helping other students commit acts of academic dishonesty by allowing them to obtain copies of your work. In short, all submitted work must be your own. Cases of academic dishonesty will be pursued to the fullest extent possible as stipulated by the <a href="https://www.studentconduct.umd.edu/" target="new">Office of Student Conduct</a><br>
    <br>
    It is very important for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating, fabrication, facilitation, and plagiarism. For more information on the Code of Academic Integrity or the Student Honor Council, please visit <a href="http://www.shc.umd.edu" target="new">http://www.shc.umd.edu</a>.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Academic Integrity Violations</h2>
	<p>The following are examples of academic integrity violations:</p>
  <ul style="padding-left: 60px">
    <li> Hardcoding of results in a project assignment. Hardcoding
      refers to attempting to make a program appear as if it works
      correctly (e.g., printing expected results for a test). </li>
    <li> Using any code available on the internet/web or any other
      source. For example, using code from Sourceforge. </li>
    <li> Hiring any online service to complete an assignment for
      you. </li>
    <li> <strong> You may not post the implementation of your
      assignments, materials related to the class (e.g., project
      description), or any other material associated with this
      course. Even if the class is over and you have graduated,
      you may NOT post any material. If you do, you might be
      violating academic integrity rules and copyrights. </strong> </li>
    <li> Discussing projects with your classmates. </li>
    <li> Sharing your code or your student tests with any student. </li>
    <li> Providing ideas/suggestions on how to solve/implement a
      programming assignment. </li>
    <li> Looking at another student's code. </li>
    <li>Using online forums to ask for help regarding our
      assignments.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Additional information can be found in the sections titled
    "Academic Integrity" and "Code of Student Conduct" available at <a href="http://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html">Course
    Related Policies</a>.</p>
  <br>
  <h2> Disabilities Support Accommodations</h2>
  <p>In case academic accommodations are needed, you must provide a
    letter of accommodation from the Office of Accessibility and
    Disability Services (ADS) within the first TWO weeks of the
    semester. For details, see the section titled
    "Accessibility" available at <a href="http://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html">Course
    Related Policies</a>.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Excused Absence and Academic Accommodations</h2>
  <p>The university allows for
    self-documentation for some absences. If you need to be
    excused for an absence from a single lecture, recitation, or lab
    due to your illness (or other reasons), you shall make a
    reasonable attempt to report prior to the class. (Use
    the absence report feature in the grade server).<br>
    <br>
    Upon returning to the class, present with a self-signed note
    attesting to the date of your illness (or other reasons). 
    Each note must contain an acknowledgment by the student that the
    information provided is true and correct. Providing false
    information to University officials is prohibited under Part 9(i)
    of the Code of Student Conduct (V-1.00(B) University of Maryland
    Code of Student Conduct) and may result in disciplinary action. <br>
    <br>
    <strong> Self-documentation may NOT be used for the midterm exams
    and the final exam</strong>, and it may only be used for only 1
    class meeting (or more, if you choose) during the semester.
    Any student who needs to be excused for a prolonged absence (2 or
    more consecutive class meetings), or for the exams, must provide
    written documentation of the illness from the Health Center or
    from an outside health care provider. This documentation must
    verify dates of treatment and indicate the time frame that the
    student was unable to meet academic responsibilities. In addition,
    it must contain the name and phone number of the medical service
    provider to be used if verification is needed. No diagnostic
    information will ever be requested. Note that the "Medical
    Discharge Summary" from the Health Center will NOT be accepted as
    evidence of doctor's recommendation for your absence. <br>
    <br>
    For additional details, see the section titled "Attendance,
    Absences, or Missed Assignments" available at <a href="http://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html">Course Related Policies</a> </p>
